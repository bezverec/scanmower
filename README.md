ScanMower is a program written in pure Rust. It's basically a simplified version of the legendary ScanTailor created from the ground up. A tool for batch cropping and deskewing your images manually and semi-automatically. It has been created for educational purposes, it is **NOT** suitable for production use. You should be fine using it for generating user copies from your archival (master) images, unless you require specific image parameters.

## Limitations
- The automatic deskewing and cropping is rudimentary - not producing any reliable results.
- There are no advanced features such as dewarping.
- The output images are not 1:1 copies of the original images in terms of image parameters / metadata.
- The first release has not been properly tested - v0.1.0 is therefore experimental alpha build at best.

## TO-DO
- English localization.
- Code cleanup.
- General and bug fixing.
  
## Dream features (ETA unknown; or never to be implemented)
- Better image parameters preservation.
- AI image processing using a custom mini LM?
- Better non-AI auto image processing.

## AI generetad code disclosure
- The code is AI generetated using ChatGPT model 5.
