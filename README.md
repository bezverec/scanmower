ScanMower is a program written in pure Rust. It's basically a simplified version of the legendary ScanTailor created from the ground up. A tool for batch cropping and deskewing your images manually and semi-automatically. It has been created for educational purposes, it is **NOT** suitable for production use. You should be fine using it for generating user copies from your archival (master) images, unless you require specific image parameters.
