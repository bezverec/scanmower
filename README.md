ScanMower is a program written in pure Rust. It's basically a simplified version of the legendary ScanTailor created from the ground up. A tool for batch cropping and deskewing your images manually and semi-automatically. It has been created for educational purposes, it is **NOT** suitable for production use. You should be fine using it for generating user copies from your archival (master) images, unless you require specific image parameters.

## Limitations
- The automatic deskewing and cropping is rudimentary.
- There are no advanced features such as dewarping.
- The output images are not be 1:1 copies with only the cropping and deskewing applied.

## Dream features (ETA unknown)
- Better image parameters preservation.
- AI image processing using a custom mini LM?
- Better non-AI auto image processing.
